# 🚧 Road Accident Project Using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data using **Power BI** to understand accident trends, casualty patterns, and the impact of various factors such as vehicle type, road condition, weather, and lighting conditions.

The dashboard helps in identifying high-risk areas and supports data-driven decisions for improving road safety.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze total accidents and casualties
- Compare current year vs previous year casualties
- Identify accident distribution by vehicle type
- Study urban vs rural accident patterns
- Analyze impact of road type, road surface, weather, and daylight conditions
- Visualize accident locations using map visuals
